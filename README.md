# MAWanalysis

This repository contains code relevant to MAW analysis for different studies.

## Polyphenols
The Polyphenol project used files in MGF were first  converted to mzML, then MAW-R, MAW-SIRIUS and MAW-Py were used one after other in docker containers corresponding to   [MAW v1.5.0](https://github.com/zmahnoor14/MAW/releases/tag/v1.5.0). Lastly, the results were postprocessed, extracting MSI-levels and a sunburst plot.
